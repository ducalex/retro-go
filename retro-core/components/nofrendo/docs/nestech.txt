    I am in no way held responsible for the results of this information.
    This is public-domain information, and should not be used for commercial
    purposes.  If you wish to use this document for commercial purposes,
    please contact me prior to development, so that I may discuss the outline
    of your project with you. I am not trying to hinder anyone financially:
    if you wish to do real Nintendo Entertainment System development, con-
    tacting either Nintendo of America or Nintendo Company, Ltd. would be
    wise. Their addresses are listed here:

  B. Why?
  -------
    At the time this document was created, there was only one piece of lit-
    erature covering the internals to the NES: Marat Fayzullin's documen-
    tation, otherwise known as "NES.DOC".

    While Fayzullin's documentation was lacking in many areas, it provided a
    strong base for the basics, and in itself truly stated how complex the
    little grey box was.

    I took the opportunity to expand on "NES.DOC," basing other people's
    findings, as well as my own, on experience; experience which has helped
    make this document what it has become today. The beginning stages of this
    document looked almost like a replica of Fayzullin's documentation, with
    both minor and severe changes. Marat Fayzullin himself later picked up a
    copy of my documentation, and later began referring people to it.

    Keep in mind, without Marat's "NES.DOC" document, I would have never had
    any incentive to write this one.


  C. Mission
  ----------
    The goal of this document is simplistic: to provide accurate and up-to-
    date information regarding the Nintendo Entertainment System, and it's
    Famicom counterpart.


  D. Dedications
  --------------
    I'd like to dedicate this document to Alex Krasivsky. Alex has been a
    great friend, and in my eyes, truly started the ball of emulation
    rolling. During the good times, and the bad times, Alex was there.
    Spasibo, Alex; umnyj Russki...


  E. "Thank You"s
  ---------------
    I'd like to take the time and thank all the people who helped make this
    document what it is today. I couldn't have done it without all of you.

| 2. Acronymns |
+--------------+

  A. Internals
  ------------
    CPU     - Central Processing Unit: Self-explanitory. The NES uses a
              standard 6502 (NMOS).
    PPU     - Picture Processing Unit: Used to control graphics, sprites,
              and other video-oriented features.
    pAPU    - pseuedo-Audio Processing Unit: Native to the CPU; generates
              waveforms via (5) audio channels:: four (4) analogue, and
              one (1) digital. There is no physical IC for audio process-
              ing nor generation inside the NES.
    MMC     - Multi-Memory Controller: Micro-controllers used in NES games
              to access memory beyond the 6502 64Kbyte boundary. They can
              also be used to access extra CHR-ROM, and may be used for
              "special effects" such as forcing and IRQ, and other things.
    VRAM    - Video RAM: The RAM which is internal to the PPU. There is
              16kbits of VRAM installed in the NES.
    SPR-RAM - Sprite RAM: 256 bytes of RAM which is used for sprites. It is
              not part of VRAM nor ROM, though it's local to the PPU.
    PRG-ROM - Program ROM: The actual program-code area of memory. Also can
              be used to describe areas of code which are external to the
              actual code area and are swapped in via an MMC.
    PRG-RAM - Program RAM: Synonymous with PRG-ROM, except that it's RAM.
    CHR-ROM - Character ROM: The VRAM data which is kept external to the PPU,
              swapped in and out via an MMC, or "loaded" into VRAM during the
              power-on sequence.
    VROM    - Synonymous with CHR-ROM.
    SRAM    - Save RAM: RAM which is commonly used in RPGs such as "Cry-
              stalis," the Final Fantasy series, and "The Legend of Zelda."
    WRAM    - Synonymous with SRAM.
    DMC     - Delta Modulation Channel: The channel of the APU which handles
              digital data. Commonly referred to as the PCM (Pulse Code
              Modulation) channel.
    EX-RAM  - Expansion RAM: This is the memory used within Nintendo's MMC5,
              allowing games to extend the capabilities of VRAM.


  B. Hardware
  -----------
    NES     - Nintendo Entertainment System: Self-explanitory.
    Dandy   - Synonymous (hardware-wise) with the Famicom.
    Famicom - Synonymous with the NES, except for not supporting the RAW
              method of DMC digital audio playback.
    FDS     - Famicom Disk System: Unit which sits atop the Famicom, support-
              ing the use of 3" double-sided floppy disks for games.

| 3. CPU |
+--------+

  A. General Information
  ----------------------
    The NES uses a customized NMOS 6502 CPU, engineered and produced by
    Ricoh. It's primary customization adds audio.

    The NTSC NES runs at 1.7897725MHz, and 1.773447MHz for PAL.


  B. Memory Map
  -------------
    +---------+-------+-------+-----------------------+
    | Address | Size  | Flags | Description           |
    +---------+-------+-------+-----------------------+
    | $0000   | $800  |       | RAM                   |
    | $0800   | $800  | M     | RAM                   |
    | $1000   | $800  | M     | RAM                   |
    | $1800   | $800  | M     | RAM                   |

    | $2008   | $1FF8 |  R    | Registers             |
    | $4000   | $20   |       | Registers             |
    | $4020   | $1FDF |       | Expansion ROM         |

    | $C000   | $4000 |       | PRG-ROM               |
    +---------+-------+-------+-----------------------+
           Flag Legend: M = Mirror of $0000
                        R = Mirror of $2000-2008 every 8 bytes
                            (e.g. $2008=$2000, $2018=$2000, etc.)


  C. Interrupts
  -------------
    The 6502 has three (3) interrupts: IRQ/BRK, NMI, and RESET.

    Each interrupt has a vector. A vector is a 16-bit address which spec-
    ifies a location to "jump to" when the interrupt is triggered.

    IRQ/BRK is triggered under two circumstances, hence it's split name:
    when a software IRQ is executed (the BRK instruction), or when a
    hardware IRQ is executed (via the IRQ line).

    RESET is triggered on power-up. The ROM is loaded into memory, and
    the 6502 jumps to the address specified in the RESET vector. No registers
    are modified, and no memory is cleared; these only occur during power-up.

    NMI stands for Non-Maskable Interrupt, and is generated by each refresh
    (VBlank), which occurs at different intervals depending upon the system
    used (PAL/NTSC).

    NMI is updated 60 times/sec. on NTSC consoles, and 50 times/sec on PAL.
    Interrupt latency on the 6502 is seven (7) cycles; this means it takes
    seven (7) cycles to move in and out of an interrupt.

    Most interrupts should return using the RTI instruction. Some NES carts
    do not use this method, such as SquareSoft's "Final Fantasy 1" title.
    These carts return from interrupts in a very odd fashion: by manipul-
    ating the stack by hand, and then doing an RTS. This is technically
    valid, but morally shunned.

    The aforementioned nterrupts have the following vector addresses,
    mapped to areas of ROM:

      $FFFA = NMI
      $FFFC = RESET
      $FFFE = IRQ/BRK

    Interrupt priorities are as follows:

      Highest = RESET
                NMI
       Lowest = IRQ/BRK


  D. NES-specific Customizations
  ------------------------------
    The NES's 6502 does not contain support for decimal mode. Both the
    CLD and SED opcodes function normally, but the 'd' bit of P is unused
    in both ADC and SBC. It is common practice for games to CLD prior to
    code execution, as the status of 'd' is unknown on power-on and on
    reset.

    Audio registers are mapped internal to the CPU; all waveform gener-
    ation is done internal to the CPU as well.


  E. Notes
  --------
    Please note the two separate 16K PRG-ROM segments; they may be linear,
    but they play separate roles depending upon the size of the cartridge.
    Some games only hold one (1) 16K bank of PRG-ROM, which should be
    loaded into both $C000 and $8000.

    Most games load themselves into $8000, using 32K of PRG-ROM space. The
    first game to use this method is Super Mario Brothers. However, all
    games wit more than one (1) 16K bank of PRG-ROM load themselves into
    $8000 as well. These games use Memory Mappers to swap in and out PRG-ROM
    data, as well as CHR-ROM.

    When a BRK is encountered, the NES's 6502 pushes the CPU status flag
    onto the stack with the 'b' CPU bit set. On an IRQ or NMI, the CPU
    pushes the status flag onto the stack with the 'b' bit clear. This is
    done because of the fact that a hardware IRQ (IRQ) and a software
    IRQ (BRK) both share the same vector. For example, one could use the
    following code to distinguish the difference between the two:

      C134: PLA                 ; Copy CPU status flag
      C135: PHA                 ; Return status flag to stack
      C136: AND #$10            ; Check D4 ('b' CPU bit)
      C138: BNE is_BRK_opcode   ; If set then it is a software IRQ (BRK)

    Executing BRK inside of NMI will result in the pushed 'b' bit being
    set.

    The 6502 has a bug in opcode $6C (jump absolute indirect). The CPU does
    not correctly calculate the effective address if the low-byte is $FF.
    Example:

      C100: 4F
      C1FF: 00
      C200: 23
        ..
      D000: 6C FF C1 - JMP ($C1FF)

    Logically, this will jump to address $2300. However, due to the fact
    that the high-byte of the calculate address is *NOT* increased on a
    page-wrap, this will actually jump to $4F00.

    It should be noted that page wrapping does *NOT* occur in indexed-
    indirect addressing modes. Due to limitations of zero-page, all
    indexed-indirect read/writes should apply a logical AND #$FF to
    the effective address after calculation. Example:
    
      C000: LDX #3        ; Reads indirect address from $0002+$0003,
      C002: LDA ($FF,X)   ;   not $0102+$0103.

  A. General Information
  ----------------------
    Mirroring (also referred to as "shadowing") is the process of mapping
    particular addresses or address ranges to other addresses/ranges via
    hardware.


  B. Memory Map
  -------------
    Included here are two (2) memory maps. The first is a "RAM Memory
    Map," which despite being less verbose describes the actual regions
    which point to physical RAM in the NES itself. The second is a
    "Programmer Memory Map" which is quite verbose and describes the
    entire memory region of the NES and how it's used/manipulated.

                          F = Mirror of $0000-3FFF (VRAM)


  C. Name Tables
  --------------
    The NES displays graphics using a matrix of "tiles"; this grid is called
    a Name Table. Tiles themselves are 8x8 pixels. The entire Name Table
    itself is 32x30 tiles (256x240 pixels). Keep in mind that the displayed
    resolution differs between NTSC and PAL units.

    The Name Tables holds the tile number of the data kept in the Pattern
    Table (continue on).


  D. Pattern Tables
  -----------------
    The Pattern Table contains the actual 8x8 tiles which the Name Table
    refers to. It also holds the lower two (2) bits of the 4-bit colour
    matrix needed to access all 16 colours of the NES palette. Example:

       VRAM    Contents of                     Colour 
       Addr   Pattern Table                    Result
      ------ ---------------                  --------
      $0000: %00010000 = $10 --+              ...1.... Periods are used to
        ..   %00000000 = $00   |              ..2.2... represent colour 0.
        ..   %01000100 = $44   |              .3...3.. Numbers represent
        ..   %00000000 = $00   +-- Bit 0      2.....2. the actual palette
        ..   %11111110 = $FE   |              1111111. colour #.
        ..   %00000000 = $00   |              2.....2.
        ..   %10000010 = $82   |              3.....3.
      $0007: %00000000 = $00 --+              ........

      $0008: %00000000 = $00 --+
        ..   %00101000 = $28   |
        ..   %01000100 = $44   |
        ..   %10000010 = $82   +-- Bit 1
        ..   %00000000 = $00   |
        ..   %10000010 = $82   |
        ..   %10000010 = $82   |
      $000F: %00000000 = $00 --+

    The result of the above Pattern Table is the character 'A', as shown
    in the "Colour Result" section in the upper right.


  E. Attribute Tables
  -------------------
    Each byte in an Attribute Table represents a 4x4 group of tiles on the
    screen. There's multiple ways to describe what the function of one (1)
    byte in the Attribute Table is:

      * Holds the upper two (2) bits of a 32x32 pixel grid, per 16x16 pixels.
      * Holds the upper two (2) bits of sixteen (16) 8x8 tiles.
      * Holds the upper two (2) bits of four (4) 4x4 tile grids.

    It's quite confusing; two graphical diagrams may help:

      +------------+------------+
      |  Square 0  |  Square 1  |  #0-F represents an 8x8 tile
      |   #0  #1   |   #4  #5   |
      |   #2  #3   |   #6  #7   |  Square [x] represents four (4) 8x8 tiles
      +------------+------------+   (i.e. a 16x16 pixel grid)
      |  Square 2  |  Square 3  |
      |   #8  #9   |   #C  #D   |
      |   #A  #B   |   #E  #F   |
      +------------+------------+

    The actual format of the attribute byte is the following (and corris-
    ponds to the above example):

       Attribute Byte
         (Square #)
      ----------------
          33221100
          ||||||+--- Upper two (2) colour bits for Square 0 (Tiles #0,1,2,3)
          ||||+----- Upper two (2) colour bits for Square 1 (Tiles #4,5,6,7)
          ||+------- Upper two (2) colour bits for Square 2 (Tiles #8,9,A,B)
          +--------- Upper two (2) colour bits for Square 3 (Tiles #C,D,E,F)


  F. Palettes
  -----------
    The NES has two 16-colour "palettes": the Image Palette and the Sprite
    Palette. These palettes are more of a "lookup table" than an actual
    palette, since they do not hold physical RGB values.

    D7-D6 of bytes written to $3F00-3FFF are ignored.


  G. Name Table Mirroring
  -----------------------
    One should keep in mind that there are many forms of mirroring when
    understanding the NES. Some methods even use CHR-ROM-mapped Name
    Tables (mapper-specific).

    The NES itself only contains 2048 ($800) bytes of RAM used for Name
    Tables. However, as shown in Subsection B, the NES has the capability
    of addressing up to four (4) Name Tables.

    By default, many carts come with "horizontal" and "vertical" mirroring,
    allowing you to change where the Name Tables point into the NES's PPU
    RAM. This form of mirroring affects two (2) Name Tables simultaneously;
    you cannot switch Name Tables independently.

    The following chart should assist in understanding all the types of
    mirroring encountered on the NES. Please note that the addresses
    shown (12-bit in size) refer to the Name Table portion of the NES's
    PPU RAM; one may consider these synonymous with "$2xxx" in the VRAM
    region:

        Name                       NT#0   NT#1   NT#2   NT#3   Flags
      +--------------------------+------+------+------+------+-------+
      | Horizontal               | $000 | $000 | $400 | $400 |       | 
      | Vertical                 | $000 | $400 | $000 | $400 |       | 
      | Four-screen              | $000 | $400 | $800 | $C00 | F     | 
      | Single-screen            |      |      |      |      |  S    | 
      | CHR-ROM mirroring        |      |      |      |      |   C   |
      +--------------------------+------+------+------+------+-------+
        F = Four-screen mirroring relies on an extra 2048 ($800) of RAM
            (kept on the cart), resulting in four (4) physical independent
            Name Tables.
        S = Single-screen games have mappers which allow you to select
            which PPU RAM area you want to use ($000, $400, $800, or
            $C00); all the NTs point to the same PPU RAM address.
        C = Mapper #68 (Afterburner 2) allows you to map CHR-ROM to the
            Name Table region of the NES's PPU RAM area. Naturally this
            makes the Name Table ROM-based, and one cannot write to it.
            However, this feature can be controlled via the mapper itself,
            allowing you to enable or disable this feature.


  H. Palette Mirroring
  --------------------
    Mirroring occurs between the Image Palette and the Sprite Palette.
    Any data which is written to $3F00 is mirrored to $3F10. Any data
    written to $3F04 is mirrored to $3F14, etc. etc...

    Colour #0 in the upper three (3) palettes of both the Image and Sprite
    palette defines transparency (the actual colour stored there is not
    drawn on-screen).

    The PPU uses the value in $3F00 to define background colour.

    For a more verbose explanation, assume the following:

      * $0D has been written to $3F00 (mirrored to $3F10)
      * $03 has been written to $3F08 (mirrored to $3F18)
      * $1A has been written to $3F18
      * $3F08 is read into the accumulator

    The PPU will use $0D as the background colour, despite $3F08 holding
    a value of $03 (since colour #0 in all the palette entries defines
    transparency, it is not drawn). Finally, the accumulator will hold
    a value of $1A, which is mirrored from $3F18. Again, the value of $1A
    is not drawn, since colour #0 defines transparency.

    The entire Image and Sprite Palettes are both mirrored to other areas
    of VRAM as well; $3F20-3FFF are mirrors of both palettes, respectively.

    D7-D6 of bytes written to $3F00-3FFF are ignored.


  I. Background Scrolling
  -----------------------
    The NES can scroll the background (pre-rendered Name Table + Pattern
    Table + Attribute Table) independently of the sprites which are over-
    layed on top of it. The background can be scrolled horizontally and
    vertically.

    Scrolling works as follows:

      Horizontal Scrolling             Vertical Scrolling
        0          512
        +-----+-----+                      +-----+ 0
        |     |     |                      |     |
        |  A  |  B  |                      |  A  |
        |     |     |                      |     |
        +-----+-----+                      +-----+
                                           |     |
                                           |  B  |
                                           |     |
                                           +-----+ 480

    Name Table "A" is specified via Bits D1-D0 in register $2000, and "B" is
    the Name Table after (due to mirroring, this is dynamic). This doesn't
    work for game which use Horizontal & Vertical scrolling simultaneously.

    The background will span across multiple Name Tables, as shown here:

      +---------------+---------------+
      | Name Table #2 | Name Table #3 |
      |    ($2800)    |    ($2C00)    |
      +---------------+---------------+
      | Name Table #0 | Name Table #1 |
      |    ($2000)    |    ($2400)    |
      +---------------+---------------+

    Writes to the Horizontal Scroll value in $2005 range from 0 to 256.
    Writes to the Vertical Scroll value range from 0-239; values above 239
    are considered negative (e.g. a write of 248 is really -8).


  J. Screen and Sprite Layering
  -----------------------------
    There is a particular order in which the NES draws it's contents:

      FRONT                                BACK
      +----+-----------+----+-----------+-----+
      | CI | OBJs 0-63 | BG | OBJs 0-63 | EXT |
      +----+-----------+----+-----------+-----+
           | SPR-RAM   |    | SPR-RAM   |
           | BGPRI==0  |    | BGPRI==1  |
           +-----------+    +-----------+

    CI stands for 'Colour Intensity', which is synonmous with D7-D5 of
    $2001. BG is the BackGround, and EXT is for the EXTension port video
    signal.

    'BGPRI' represents the 'Background Priority' bit in SPR-RAM, on a
    per-sprite basis (D5, Byte 2).

    OBJ numbers represent actual Sprite numbers, not Tile Index values.

    FRONT is considered what is seen atop all other layers (drawn last),
    and BACK is deemed what is below most other layers (drawn first).


  K. Sprites and SPR-RAM
  ----------------------
    The NES supports 64 sprites, which can be either 8x8 or 8x16 pixels in
    size. The sprite data is kept within the Pattern Table region of VRAM.

    Sprite attributes such as flipping and priority, are stored in SPR-RAM,
    which is a separate 256 byte area of memory, independent of ROM and
    VRAM. The format of SPR-RAM is as follows:

      +-----------+-----------+-----+------------+
      | Sprite #0 | Sprite #1 | ... | Sprite #63 |
      +-+------+--+-----------+-----+------------+
        |      |   
        +------+----------+--------------------------------------+
        + Byte | Bits     | Description                          |
        +------+----------+--------------------------------------+
        |  0   | YYYYYYYY | Y Coordinate - 1. Consider the coor- |
        |      |          | dinate the upper-left corner of the  |
        |      |          | sprite itself.                       |
        |  1   | IIIIIIII | Tile Index #                         |
        |  2   | vhp000cc | Attributes                           |
        |      |          |   v = Vertical Flip   (1=Flip)       |
        |      |          |   h = Horizontal Flip (1=Flip)       |
        |      |          |   p = Background Priority            |
        |      |          |         0 = In front                 |
        |      |          |         1 = Behind                   |
        |      |          |   c = Upper two (2) bits of colour   |
        |  3   | XXXXXXXX | X Coordinate (upper-left corner)     |
        +------+----------+--------------------------------------+

    The Tile Index # is obtained the same way as Name Table data.

    Sprites which are 8x16 in size function a little bit differently. A
    8x16 sprite which has an even-numbered Tile Index # use the Pattern
    Table at $0000 in VRAM; odd-numbered Tile Index #s use $1000.
    *NOTE*: Register $2000 has no effect on 8x16 sprites.

    All 64 sprites contain an internal priority; sprite #0 is of a higher
    priority than sprites #63 (sprite #0 should be drawn last, etc.).

    Only eight (8) sprites can be displayed per scan-line. Each entry in
    SPR-RAM is checked to see if it's in a horizontal range with the other
    sprites. Remember, this is done on a per scan-line basis, not on a per
    sprite basis (e.g. done 256 times, not 256/8 or 256/16 times).

    (NOTE: On a real NES unit, if sprites are disabled (D4 of $2001 is 0)
    for a long period of time, SPR-RAM will gradually degrade. A proposed
    concept is that SPR-RAM is actually DRAM, and D4 controls the DRAM
    refresh cycle).


  L. Sprite #0 Hit Flag
  ---------------------
    The PPU is capable of figuring out where Sprite #0 is, and stores
    it's findings in D6 of $2002. The way this works is as follows:

    The PPU scans for the first actual non-transparent "sprite pixel" and
    the first non-transparent "background pixel." A "background pixel" is
    a tile which is in use by the Name Table. Remember that colour #0
    defines transparency.

    The pixel which causes D6 to be set *IS* drawn.
    
    The following example should help. The following are two tiles.
    Transparent colours (colour #0) are defined via the underscore ('_')
    character. An asterisk ('*') represents when D6 will be set.

       Sprite         BG         Result
       ------         --         ------
      __1111__     ________     __1111__
      _111111_     _______2     _1111112    
      11222211     ______21     11222211
      112__211  +  _____211  =  112__*11  '*' will be drawn as colour #2
      112__211     ____2111     112_2211
      11222211     ___21111     11222211
      _111111_     __211111     _1111111
      __1111__     _2111111     _2111111

    This also applies to sprites that are underneathe the BG (via the
    'Background Priority' SPR-RAM bit), though the above example would
    be 'BG+Sprite'.

    Also, D6 is cleared (set to 0) after each VBlank.


  M. Horizontal and Vertical Blanking
  -----------------------------------
    The NES, like every console, has a refresh: where the display device
    relocates the electron gun to display visible data. The most common
    display device is a television set. The refresh occurs 60 times a
    second on an NTSC device, and 50 on a PAL device.

    The gun itself draws pixels left to right: this process results in
    one (1) horizontal scanline being drawn. After the gun is done drawing
    the entire scanline, the gun must return to the left side of the
    display device, becoming ready to draw the next scanline. The process
    of the gun returning to the left side of the display is the Horizontal
    Blank period (HBlank).

    When the gun has completed drawing all of the scanlines, it must return
    to the top of the display device; the time it takes for the gun to
    re-position itself atop the device is called the Vertical Blank period
    (VBlank).

    As you can see from the below diagram, the gun more or less works in
    a zig-zag pattern until VBlank is reached, then the process repeats:

           +-----------+
      +--->|***********| <-- Scanline 0
      |    | ___---~~~ | <-- HBlank
      V    |***********| <-- Scanline 1
      B    | ___---~~~ | <-- HBlank
      l    |    ...    |      ...
      a    |    ...    |      ...
      n    |***********| <-- Scanline 239
      k    +-----+-----+
      |          |
      +--VBlank--+

    An NTSC NES has the following refresh and screen layout:

      +--------+ 0 ----+
      |        |       |
      |        |       |
      | Screen |       +-- (0-239) 256x240 on-screen results
      |        |       |
      |        |       |
      +--------+ 240 --+
      |   ??   |       +-- (240-242) Unknown
      +--------+ 243 --+
      |        |       |
      | VBlank |       +-- (243-262) VBlank
      |        |       |
      +--------+ 262 --+

    The Vertical Blank (VBlank) flag is contained in D7 of $2002. It
    indicates whether PPU is in VBlank or not. A program can reset D7 by
    reading $2002.


  N. $2005/2006 Magic
  -------------------
     For detailed information pertaining to the $2005 and $2006 registers,
     refer to Loopy's $2005/2006 document. His document provides entirely
     accurate information regarding how these registers work. Contact
     Loopy for more information.


  O. PPU Quirks
  -------------
    The first read from VRAM is invalid. Due to this aspect, the NES will
    returned pseudo-buffered values from VRAM rather than linear as expec-
    ted. See the below example:

    VRAM $2000 contains $AA $BB $CC $DD.
    VRAM incrementation value is 1.
    The result of execution is printed in the comment field. 

      LDA #$20
      STA $2006
      LDA #$00
      STA $2006        ; VRAM address now set at $2000
      LDA $2007        ; A=??     VRAM Buffer=$AA
      LDA $2007        ; A=$AA    VRAM Buffer=$BB
      LDA $2007        ; A=$BB    VRAM Buffer=$CC
      LDA #$20
      STA $2006
      LDA #$00
      STA $2006        ; VRAM address now set at $2000
      LDA $2007        ; A=$CC    VRAM Buffer=$AA
      LDA $2007        ; A=$AA    VRAM Buffer=$BB

    As shown, the PPU will post-increment it's internal address data after
    the first read is performed. This *ONLY APPLIES* to VRAM $0000-3EFF
    (e.g. Palette data and their respective mirrors do not suffer from
    this phenomenon).


  P. Notes
  --------
    The PPU will auto-increment the VRAM address by 1 or 32 (based on D2
    of $2000) after accessing $2007.

   be completed when someone decides to reverse engineer the pAPU section
   of the NES, and provide me with information (or a reference to infor-
   mation).

| 6. Joypads, paddles, expansion ports |
+--------------------------------------+

  A. General Information
  ----------------------
    The NES supports a myriad of input devices, including joypads, Zappers
    (light guns), and four-player devices.

    Joypad #1 and #2 are accessed via $4016 and $4017, respectively.

    The joypads are reset via a strobing-method: writing 1, then 0, to
    $4016. See Subsection H for information regarding "half-strobing."

    On a full strobe, the joypad's button status will be returned in a
    single-bit stream (D0). Multiple reads need to be made to read all the
    information about the controller.

      1 = A          9 = Ignored   17 = +--+
      2 = B         10 = Ignored   18 =    +-- Signature
      3 = SELECT    11 = Ignored   19 =    |
      4 = START     12 = Ignored   20 = +--+
      5 = UP        13 = Ignored   21 = 0
      6 = DOWN      14 = Ignored   22 = 0
      7 = LEFT      15 = Ignored   23 = 0
      8 = RIGHT     16 = Ignored   24 = 0

    See Subsection G for information about Signatures.


  B. The Zapper
  -------------
    The Zapper (otherwise known as the "Light Gun") simply uses bits
    within $4016 and $4017, described in Section 8. See bits D4, D3, and
    D0.

    It is possible to have two Zapper units connected to both joypad
    ports simultaneously.


  C. Four-player devices
  ----------------------
    Some NES games allow the use of a four-player adapter, extending the
    number of usable joypads from two (2) to four (4). Carts which use
    the quad-player device are Tengen's "Gauntlet II," and Nintendo's
    "RC Pro Am 2."

    All four (4) controllers read their status-bits from D0 of $4016 or
    $4017, as Subsection A states.

    For register $4016, reads #1-8 control joypad #1, and reads #9-16
    control joypad #3. For $4017, it is respective for joypad #2 and #4.

    The following is a list of read #s and their results.

      1 = A          9 = A         17 = +--+
      2 = B         10 = B         18 =    +-- Signature
      3 = SELECT    11 = SELECT    19 =    |
      4 = START     12 = START     20 = +--+
      5 = UP        13 = UP        21 = 0
      6 = DOWN      14 = DOWN      22 = 0
      7 = LEFT      15 = LEFT      23 = 0
      8 = RIGHT     16 = RIGHT     24 = 0

    See Subsection G for information about Signatures.


  D. Paddles
  ----------
    Taito's "Arkanoid"  uses a paddle as it's primary controller.

    The paddle position is read via D1 of $4017; the read data is inverted
    (0=1, 1=0). The first value read is the MSB, and the 8th value read is
    (obviously) the LSB. Valid value ranges are 98 to 242, where 98 rep-
    resents the paddle being turned completely counter-clockwise.

    For example, if %01101011 is read, the value would be NOT'd, making
    %10010100 which is 146.

    The paddle also contains one button, which is read via D1 of $4016. A
    value of 1 specifies that the button is being pressed.


  E. Power Pad
  ------------
    No information is currently available.


  F. R.O.B. (Robot Operated Buddy)
  --------------------------------
    No information is currently available.


  G. Signatures
  -------------
    A signature allows the programmer to detect if a device is connected
    to one of the four (4) ports or not, and if so, what type of device it
    is. Valid/known signatures are:

      %0000 = Disconnected
      %0001 = Joypad ($4016 only)
      %0010 = Joypad ($4017 only)


  H. Expansion ports
  ------------------
    The joypad strobing process requires dual writes: 1, then 0. If the
    strobing process is not completed, or occurs in a non-standard order,
    the joypads are no longer the item of communication: the expansion
    port is.

    For NES users, the expansion port is located on the bottom of the unit,
    covered by a small grey piece of plastic. Famicom users have a limited
    expansion port on the front of their unit, which was commonly used for
    joypads or turbo-joypads.

    Such an example of communicating with the expansion port would be the
    following code:

      LDA #%00000001
      STA $4016
      STA $4017           ; Begin read mode of expansion port
      LDA #%00000011      ; Write %110 to the expansion port
      STA $4016

    I have yet to encounter a cart which actually uses this method of
    communication.

| 7. Memory Mapping Hardware |
+----------------------------+

  Due to the large number of mappers used (over 64), the "MMC" section
  which was once fluid in v0.53 of this document, has now been removed.

  All is not lost, as another document by \FireBug\ of Vertigo 2099 con-
  tains accurate information about nearly every mapper in existence. You
  can retrieve a copy via one of the following URLs:

    http://free.prohosting.com/~nintendo/mappers.nfo

  Please note I take no responsibility for the information contained in the
  aforementioned document. Contact lavos999@aol.com for more information.

| 8. Registers |
+--------------+
  Programmers communicate with the PPU and pAPU via registers, which are
  nothing more than pre-set memory locations which allow the coder to make
  changes to the NES. Without registers, programs wouldn't work: period.

  Each register is a 16-bit address. Each register has a statistics field
  in parentheses located immediately after its description. The legend:

    R = Readable                    W = Writable
    2 = Double-write register      16 = 16-bit register

  NOTE: 16-bit registers actually consist of two linear 8-bit registers,
        which can (and will be) *INDEPENDANTLY* assigned. The reason for
        specifying them as 16-bit is for ease of documentation. For
        instance, "$4002+$4003" would mean that D15-D8 would be in $4003,
        and D7-D0 would be in $4002.
  NOTE: Bits not listed are to be considered unused.

  A. General Information
  ----------------------
    None.


  B. CPU Notes
  ------------
    None. See Section 11, Subsection B for more possible information.


  C. PPU Notes
  ------------
    Reading and writing to VRAM consists of a multi-step process:

      Writing to VRAM                    Reading from VRAM
      ---------------                    -----------------
      1) Wait for VBlank                 1) Wait for VBlank
      2) Write upper VRAM address        2) Write upper VRAM address
         byte into $2006                    byte into $2006
      3) Write lower VRAM address        3) Write lower VRAM address
         byte into $2006                    byte into $2006
      4) Write data to $2007             4) Read $2007 (invalid data once)
                                         5) Read data from $2007

    NOTE: Step #4 when reading VRAM is only necessary when reading
          VRAM data not in the $3F00-3FFF range.

    NOTE: Accessing VRAM should only be performed during VBlank. Attempts
          to access VRAM outside of VBlank will usually result in garbage
          showing up on the screen. See Section 4, Subsection N for more
          information regarding why this occurs.

    Waiting for VBlank is quite simple:

      8000: LDA $2002
            BPL $8000

    Reading $2002 will result in all bits being returned; however, D7
    will be reset to 0 after the read is performed.

    The actual on-screen palette used by the NES, as stated prior, is not
    RGB. However, a near-exact replica can be found in common NES emulators
    today. Contact the appropriate authors of these emulators to obtain
    a valid RGB palette.

    Be sure to clear the internal VRAM address via $2006 semi-often. You
    will often encounter a situation where a palette fade or a VRAM update
    will cause the screen "to be trashed" (squares on the screen, or what
    seem to be graphical "glitches"). The reason for this is that your code
    took longer than a VBlank. When the VBlank goes to refresh the screen
    with the data in the PPU, it takes whatever value is in the internal
    VRAM address and uses that as the starting base for Name Table #0.
    The solution is to fix your code by re-assigning the VRAM address to
    $0000 (or $2000), so that the refresh may occur successfully. Such
    code would be:

      LDA #$00
      STA $2006
      STA $2006

    You will find code like this in commercial games quite often.

| 11. Emulation |
+---------------+

  A. General Information
  ----------------------
    If you're going to be programming an emulator in C or C++, please be
    familiar with pointers. Being familiar with pointers will help you
    out severely when it comes to handling mirroring and VRAM addressing.
    For you assembly buffs out there, obviously pointers are nothing more
    than indirect addressing -- it's easier to change a 32-bit value than
    to swap in and out an entire 64K of data.

    When SRAM ($6000-7FFF) is disabled, writes to the memory area should
    be ignored. Reads will possibly return data previously left on the
    bus, and therefore when emulated should return 0 (or should be trap-
    ped).

    RAM-based memory areas ($0000-07FF) should *NOT* be zeroed on RESET;
    they should be zeroed on power on/off. (Technically, the RAM is not
    zeroed on power on/off either: the RAM will slowly dissapate over
    time when the unit it off. However, for emulation purposes, please
    make sure that a cold boot and a warm boot do different things).

    See Section 12, Subsection E for Mailing List information.


  B. CPU Notes
  ------------
    The NES does not use a 65c02 (CMOS) CPU as rumored.

    Ignore opcodes which are bad (or support the option of trapping them).
    Some ROM images out there, such as "Adventures of Lolo" contain bad
    opcodes, due to dirty connectors on the cartridge during the extract-
    ion process (or other reasons).

    There are 154 valid opcodes (out of 256 total) on the NES.


  C. PPU Notes
  ------------
    The formulae to calculate the base address of a Name Table tile number
    is:

      (TILENUM * 16) + PATTERNTABLE

    Where TILENUM is the tile number in the Name Table, and PATTERNTABLE
    is the Pattern Table Address defined via register $2000.

    It's recommended that DOS programmers use what is known as "MODE-Q,"
    a 256x256x256 "tweaked" video mode, for writing their emulator. Try to
    avoid Mode-X modes, as they are non-chained, and result in painfully
    slow graphics. Chained modes (like MODE-13h) are linear, and work
    best for speedy graphics. Since the NES's resolution is 256x240, the
    aforementioned "MODE-Q" should meet all necessary requirements.

    Most emulators do not limit the number of sprites which can be displayed
    per scanline, while the actual NES will show flicker as a result of more
    than eight (8). {Put some more garbage here; it's early...}

    Emulators should _NOT_ mask out unused bits within registers; doing so
    may result in a cart not working.

  E. Mailing Lists
  ----------------
    There is a NES Development Mailing List in existence. Contact Mark Knibbs
    for more information. This list is for anyone who wishes to discuss tech-
    nical issues about the NES; it is not a list for picking up the latest
    and greatest information about NES emulators or what not.


  F. WWW Sites
  ------------
    The following are a list of WWW sites which contain NES-oriented
    material. If you encounter errors, bad links, or other anomolies
    while visiting these sites, contact the site authors/owners, NOT
    me. Thanks.

    http://nesdev.parodius.com/

      Contains a verbose amount of documentation regarding anything
      NES-oriented, including hard-to-find mapper documentation. Seems
      to be a decent NES information depository.

    http://www.ameth.org/~veilleux/NES_info.html

      Currently only contains hardware-oriented material, such as
      overviews of cart and unit ASICs, mappers, and MMCs. Many
      pinout diagrams for mappers and NES units are available here.
      Also provides documentation on NES repair, modifying your NES
      to give stereo output, applying stereo mixing to your NES, and
      much much more.


  G. Hardware Information
  -----------------------
    The following security bits may be purchased from MCM Electronics
    (http://www.mcmelectronics.com/):

      For NES carts: 22-1145 (3.8mm security bit)
      For NES units: 22-1150 (4.5mm security bit)

    The 4.5mm security screw is also used for the Super Nintendo Enter-
    tainment System (SNES), and Nintendo 64.
