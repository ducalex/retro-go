Audio driver for piezoelectric buzzer
=====================================
Getting a piezoelectric buzzer to produce Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM) audio without a Digital-to-Analog-Converter (DAC) isn't trivial.
It also doesn't sound as great or loud as a real speaker. But it sounds okay when done properly, and it's better than nothing.

Typically, a buzzer is driven "high" and "low" at a certain frequency to produce a square wave of an audio signal.
For example: if the buzzer is turned on and off at 440Hz, an "A" note (with a sharp timbre, due to the square wave) is heard.

The position of the piezoelectric buzzer is actually proportional to the output voltage on RG_AUDIO_USE_BUZZER_PIN.
So a voltage of 1.65V of 3.3V total will cause the position of the buzzer's ceramic disk to be halfway.

This can be used to output audio, but without a DAC, the only way to approximate an analog output voltage in the range of 0 and 3.3V
on the pin is by quickly turning that pin on and off, using the Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) facilities of the ESP32 microcontroller.

For example: to get an average voltage of 1.1V, the PWM can be configured for a high frequency (say 32kHz) with a duty cycle of 33.33%.
Then the pin will be high 1/3 of the time and low 2/3 of of the time, resulting in an average output voltage of 1.1V.

To produce acceptable sound, the duty cycle of the PWM output should be adjusted at least as often as the samplerate of
the PCM input audio, typically 22050-48000 Hz. It should also be adjusted at precisely the right moment.

To achieve this timing precision, the General Purpose Timer provisions of the ESP32 microcontroller are used.
It's configured to trigger an interrupt handler at the right moment, which then sets the PWM duty cycle.

One challenge is that the audio should always keep playing, even when the chip is very busy rendering a frame or parsing
user input. To achieve this, audio samples are buffered in a queue, and the timing of each frame is dynamically adjusted
to ensure the queue never underflows, nor overflows. 

Note that there are some restrictions on how high the PWM frequency can be, and a tradeoff with the precision of the duty cycle.
