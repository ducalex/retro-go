# Notes:
# - Enabling netplay in an emulator increases its size by ~350KB (~450KB in esp-idf 4.0)
# - Enabling profiling in an emulator increases its size by ~75KB (without no-inline)
# - Keep at least 32KB free in a partition for future updates
# - Partitions must be 64K aligned
# - Partitions of type data are ignored when building a .fw.
# - Subtypes and offsets and size may be adjusted when building a .fw or .img
