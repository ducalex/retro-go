 * DESCRIPTION:
 *      Lookup tables.
 *      Do not try to look them up :-).
 *      In the order of appearance:
 *
 *      int finetangent[4096]   - Tangens LUT.
 *       Should work with BAM fairly well (12 of 16bit,
 *      effectively, by shifting).
 *
 *      int finesine[10240]             - Sine lookup.
 *       Guess what, serves as cosine, too.
 *       Remarkable thing is, how to use BAMs with this?
 *
 *      int tantoangle[2049]    - ArcTan LUT,
 *        maps tan(angle) to angle fast. Gotta search.
