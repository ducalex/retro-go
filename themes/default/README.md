This is the default theme built into retro-go at compile time.

It can be used as a template to create a new theme.

The `theme.json` provided here is meant to be used as a reference when creating a new theme. It might not always be up to date with the actual default theme. Modifying it here won't impact retro-go either, you have to change the code for that.

The actual values used in retro-go are hard coded in the code in the following places:

- `components/retro-go/rg_gui.c`
- `launcher/main/gui.c`
